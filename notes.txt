0-5
	"I've beaten you five times in a row..."
	"Do you want some advice?"
	[Yes]
		"What do you want help with?"
		[General]
			"Battle prep is all about balancing Opportunity Cost!"
			"For every Pokemon, move, or item you choose, you're giving up the
			opportunity to have something else in that spot."
			"Experiment to find what gives you the biggest bang for your buck!"
		[Party]
			"Check if several of your Pokemon are weak to the same types,
			and make sure you have a way to deal with those types."
			"Don't worry too much about having all your Pokemon be different types though."
			"There are lots of different strategies, from balanced to all-out offence or defence."
			"Find one that you like and commit to it!"
		[Moves]
			"Make sure your offensive Pokemon have a variety of moves."
			"Like if you only have Fire attacks, you'll get walled by any Water-type."
			"Don't ignore Status moves either!"
			"If you can do it safely, just one boost to your Attack or Speed can be huge."
		[Items]
			"Some items have downsides, but they can be extremely powerful if you plan around it."
			"For example, if you have a Choice Band, give it to a Pokemon that only uses physical attacks!"
			"Or use a move like Trick to give it to your opponent and lock them into a harmless move!"
			"Consumable items are kind of a downside too, but sometimes that one boost is all you need."
		[Training]
		
	[No]
		"I get it - you want to find your own way, right?"
		"You can test your skills against me any time!"
1-4 (or 4-1)
	"That makes it [1-4]/[4-1]."
	"But it's never too late for [you]/[me] to make a comeback!"
2-3 (or 3-2)
	"That makes it [2-3]/[3-2]."
	"Looks like we're pretty evenly matched!"
	"I couldn't have asked for a better rival."
5-0
	"You've beaten me five times in a row..."
	"Am I that weak?"
	[Yes]
		"Hey! That was a rhetorical question!"
		"Just wait - I'll take you down a notch next time!"
	[No]
		"No... We've both gotten a lot stronger as trainers."
		"And I'm just gonna keep getting stronger - so don't get comfy!"
